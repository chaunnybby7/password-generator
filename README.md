## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.



## What you will find on my website:

Step 1: Created a landing page and created flex box that's centered.

Step 2: Add event listener to generate button. A button that says "Generate Password".

Step 3: Used Window.prompt() asking the (input) desired number of characters for password, with the range of between 8 to 128 characters. 

Step 4: Used Window.alert() to tell user to select a number between 8-128 characters. The prompt will only continue when the if conditions are met.

Step 5: Functions and window.prompts are created with if conditional statements to determine if users want to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters in their password. 

Step 6: A generatePassword function is created to take all the input from the previous functions. Generate a password using a random number generator and the charAt method.

Step 7: Used Math.floor() and Math.random() functions.
