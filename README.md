This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.
This application will run in the browser. 


## Description üìù
```

Step 1: Created a landing page and created flex box that's centered.

Step 2: Add event listener to generate button. A button that says "Generate Password".

Step 3: Used `window.prompt()` asking the (input) desired number of characters for password, with the range of between 8 to 128 characters. 

Step 4: Used `window.alert()` to tell user to select a number between 8-128 characters. The prompt will only continue when the if conditions are met.

Step 5: A generatePassword function is created to take all the input from the previous functions. Generate a password using a random number generator and the charAt method.

Step 6: Used `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` functions.
```
## Code Snippet üìü


Here's the an example of using window.prompt() method to create a password thart is between 8 - 128 characters.

```

    pwLength = prompt("Please enter the number of characters you want for your new password. (between 8-128 characters): \n(Please type in a number between 8 to 128.) ");

// if conditional statement, if the typed password length is less than 8, an error message will display.

    if (pwLength < 8){ /*If the input number is less than 8, there will be an alert message telling you the password length must be between 8 - 128. */
      alert("Password length must be a number between 8-128 characters");
      determineLength();
    } else if (pwLength > 128){ 
      alert("Password length must be a number between 8-128 characters");
      determineLength();
    } else if (isNaN(pwLength)){
      alert("Password length must be a number between 8-128 characters");
      determineLength();
    } else {
    alert("If you choose 'No' for all, your password will only contain lowercase letters.");
    }
    return pwLength;
}
```
